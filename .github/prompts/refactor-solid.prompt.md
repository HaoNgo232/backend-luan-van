# Refactor to SOLID - Code Quality Improvement

Help me refactor #file to follow SOLID principles and clean code practices.

## Current Issues to Address

Check the file for:

- [ ] Violations of Single Responsibility Principle
- [ ] Missing error handling
- [ ] Lack of type safety (any types, missing return types)
- [ ] Poor naming conventions
- [ ] Missing validation
- [ ] Code duplication
- [ ] Complex, hard-to-test logic

## Refactoring Goals

1. **Type Safety**
   - Add explicit return types
   - Replace `any` with specific types
   - Ensure DTOs are properly typed

2. **Error Handling**
   - Wrap async operations in try-catch
   - Log errors with context
   - Return meaningful error messages

3. **SOLID Compliance**
   - Split responsibilities if needed
   - Make code open for extension
   - Depend on abstractions

4. **Testability**
   - Make functions pure where possible
   - Reduce dependencies
   - Clear inputs and outputs

## Refactoring Process

For each issue found:

1. Explain WHAT is wrong
2. Explain WHY it matters
3. Show HOW to fix it
4. Provide the refactored code

## Expected Output

```typescript
// BEFORE (with issues marked)
// [current code with comments pointing out issues]

// AFTER (refactored)
// [clean, SOLID-compliant code]
```

### Learning Points

Explain the SOLID principle(s) applied and why this refactoring improves the code for thesis quality.

Remember: This is for a thesis - clarity and correctness matter more than clever optimizations!
