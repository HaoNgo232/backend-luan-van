# Code Review - SOLID & Clean Code Checker

Review the current code changes and check against these criteria:

## Type Safety

- [ ] All async functions have explicit return types (except controllers)
- [ ] No usage of `any` type without strong justification
- [ ] DTOs have proper class-validator decorators

## SOLID Principles

- [ ] **Single Responsibility**: Each class has one clear purpose
- [ ] **Open/Closed**: Extensible without modification
- [ ] **Liskov Substitution**: Subclasses honor base contracts
- [ ] **Interface Segregation**: No fat interfaces
- [ ] **Dependency Inversion**: Depend on abstractions

## Error Handling

- [ ] All async operations wrapped in try-catch
- [ ] Errors logged with context
- [ ] Meaningful error messages for users
- [ ] Proper NestJS exceptions used

## Testing

- [ ] Unit tests present for new/modified services
- [ ] Edge cases covered
- [ ] Mock external dependencies
- [ ] Test coverage â‰¥70% for core services

## Code Quality

- [ ] Meaningful variable/function names
- [ ] No code duplication
- [ ] Functions are focused and short
- [ ] Comments explain WHY, not WHAT

## Prisma Best Practices

- [ ] Explicit select (don't expose sensitive fields)
- [ ] Proper error handling for unique constraints
- [ ] Transactions for multi-step operations
